Database related topics:
=========================


*)ddl value:
The property spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto is for database initialization. 
It is good security practice that after your database is in production state. 
Here are some commonly used ddl values:

none: The default for MySQL. We make no change to the database structure.
update: Hibernate changes the database according to the entity structures.
create: Creates the database every time but does not drop it on close.
create-drop: Creates the database and drops it when SessionFactory.




*)Repository:
In the context of software development, a repository is a component or module that acts as an 
intermediary between the application and the data source, typically a database or a file system. 
The repository is responsible for abstracting the data access layer and provides an interface for 
the application to interact with the data source.
By using a repository, the application can easily switch 
between different data sources without changing the business logic.
A repository typically provides a set of methods that represent the different operations that can be 
performed on the data source, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. 
These methods are often called CRUD methods, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
In modern application development, repositories are commonly used in conjunction with 
object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks, such as Hibernate, JPA, or Entity Framework, 
which provide a high-level abstraction of the data source and make it easier to work with 
database tables as if they were regular objects in the programming language.

Overall, a repository is an important architectural pattern that provides a layer of abstraction 
between the application and the data source, allowing the application to be more modular and easier 
to maintain.



*)refactor:
By refactoring, we can change the file name in everywhere




*)API = Application programming interface.
From frontend part a request call in backend for data. then it will show in frontend interface. 
That's is called API call.
REST API = from backend a request call in database(MYSQL).
